# Ambient-Gamepad-Max-Patch
### Ambient Gamepad Max Patch made for Ambient Night Performance at Berklee College Hosted by Matthew Davidson

This was my first time performing with Gamepad live, there are definitely a lot of things I would change about the patch now.
There are also many actions that was made for me without thinking of other users.
I hope to improve it to make it more accessible in the future because it is so much fun!

Here is my [development log](/Documents/Devlog.md).
